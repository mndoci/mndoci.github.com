This page is still a <em>Work in Progress</em>.  The goal is to replace my current portal/wiki with a combination of this page and a Github Wiki</a>

<div id="home">
I wear many hats.  Depending on the time of day and point of time, a business developer, technologist, blogger/podcaster, scientist, musician, Rubyist, and husband.  Interests include scientific computing, large scale data analysis, distributed computing, sound engineering/music production, and synthesizers.  I have a particular interest in exploring the impact of the World Wide Web and other connected technologies on the practice and communication of science.  You can find more about my professional career on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dsingh" title="Deepak Singh - LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, and about my science and tech interests on my <a href="http://mndoci.com/" title="business|bytes|genes|molecules | ruminations on science, data and computing by Deepak Singh">blog</a> and <a href="http://c2cbio.com/" title="Coast to Coast Bio Podcast">podcast</a>
